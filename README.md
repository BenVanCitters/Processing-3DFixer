Processing-3DFixer
==================

This is a modification of a processing sketch that was created by Andrew Odewahn 
(and can be found at http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/1463-create-3d-photographs-with-processing/)

The purpose of this processing sketch is to take binocular 3D images and turn them into media
that is more easily viewable on standard monitors.
